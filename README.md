# VBA Homework

## Background

This project uses VBA scripting to analyze stock market data and complete the following tasks:

The script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs: 

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * Applies conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.
